# 🧬 Evolutionary Steering Behaviors

**Autonomous vehicles that evolve over time to find food and avoid poison.**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates autonomous vehicles that evolve behaviors over time using a **genetic algorithm**. Initially, vehicles have random properties, but as the simulation runs, healthier vehicles clone themselves. The properties of new vehicles can be adjusted with thresholds, which can also be set manually using sliders.

---

## 🎮 Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Vehicles evolve by cloning healthier individuals.
- **Adjustable Properties**: Set thresholds for new vehicles using sliders.
- **Debugging Info**: Enable the “Display Debugging Info” button to view vehicle properties in real-time.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Modify food and poison spawn rates as well as nutrition values.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ralu2004/EvolutionarySteeringBehaviours.git
cd EvolutionarySteeringBehaviours
```
2. **Open index.html in a web browser to start the simulation.**
3. **Interact with the simulation:**
  - Adjust vehicle properties, spawn rates, and nutrition values using sliders.
  - Enable debugging info to see each vehicle's properties.
  - Observe how vehicles evolve over time to adapt to their environment.
