Autonomous vehicles that evolve in time in order to find food and avoid poison.

At first, vehicles have random properties, but, in time, they evolve through a genetic algorithm (healthier vehicles will clone themselves).
New vehicles` properties have thresholds that can also be set manually using sliders.

Check the diplay debugging info button in order to see the properties of the vehicles.

The food and poison spawn rate and nutrition value can also be adjusted.
